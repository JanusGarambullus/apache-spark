```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
my_first_function <- function(age, children) {

comment_on_age <- ifelse(age > 80, "You are old.", "You are young.")
comment_on_children <- ifelse(children >= 2, "You have enough children, stop reproducing!",
                                             "Go out there and make some more children!")

paste(comment_on_age, comment_on_children)
}
```

```{r}
my_first_function(85, 5)
```

Yes, it works quite well. Functions are quite intuitive to write and use.
Not let's write a function that does some common data manipulations.

```{r}
column_extract <- function(data, col) {

print(data[,col])
}

column_cutter(data, 2)
```
